The libraries used came installed with the stock cse163 conda environment and were preinstalled. If any libraries are not recognized after attempting to run the project, they should be installed through the terminal. Our data can be viewed by clicking our csv files in our repository and opening them (via numbers or excel). We have two testing files test.csv correlates with breaches.csv while test2.csv with our second dataset.

Cleanup.py exists for dataset cleaning and testing purposes, it does not need to be run.
