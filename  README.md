# Instrucitons for CSE163 Project

Your `README.md` should include:

- **How to run our project:** : 
To view our plots and visualizations, run the plots.py file and view the resulting plots in a browser.

To view our test results, run test.py and check the console to confirm the tests pass.


- **Specfics instruction team should Know :** I
The libraries used came installed with the stock cse163 conda environment and were preinstalled. Our data can be viewed by clicking our csv files in our repository and opening them (via numbers or excel).

 Anything else we need to know about running your project!
 
 Your instructions should be detailed enough that your mentor can run your code to reproduce any of the results in your report. You can assume the reader of your instructions is familiar with programming environments in Python and have read your report. You should not assume your mentor will spend time “figuring out” how to run your project with anything outside of your instructions so make sure your instructions are clear and unambiguous.
